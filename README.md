- use dotenv and .env file to keep secrets
- the CSV files in this directory contain Spanish characters that exist outside English á, é, í, ó, ú, ñ
    - for this reason when reading a CSV specify encoding="latin1" like pd.read_csv("verbs_and_sentences.csv", encoding="latin1")
    - for some reason 'cards.csv' works if you read it as utf-8, but 'verb_collocations.csv' requires you to read with the latin1 encoding
- there are some headaches that are caused by the special characters that are hard to work around, in some cases I just had to deal with them manually
- the most import table is in 'cards.csv', the text used for every flashcard is stored here
    - each card has a unique id which is a combination of verb_id, tense_id, and person_id
